>> Data Transformation Services, or DTS, is a set of objects and utilities to allow the automation of extract, transform and load  operations to or from a database. The objects are DTS packages and their components, and the utilities are called DTS tools. DTS was included with earlier versions of Microsoft SQL Server, and was almost always used with SQL Server databases, although it could be used independently with other databases. -- Wikipedia
[DTS is deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms143755(v=sql.105)?redirectedfrom=MSDN); replaced by [SSIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services?view=sql-server-ver15).
